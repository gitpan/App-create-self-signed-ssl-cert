SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides command-line utility called
    create-self-signed-ssl-cert and create-ssl-csr.

FUNCTIONS
  create_self_signed_ssl_cert(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ca => *str*

        path to CA cert file.

    *   ca_key => *str*

        path to CA key file.

    *   csr_only => *bool* (default: 0)

        If set to 1 then will only generate .csr file.

        Can be useful if want to create .csr and submit it to a CA.

    *   hostname* => *str*

    *   interactive => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   wildcard => *bool* (default: 0)

        If set to 1 then Common Name is set to *.hostname.

        Only when non-interactive

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.
